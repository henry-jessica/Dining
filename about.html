                            We love to create experiences while Dining out. And since 1998 we’ve been committed to empowering that experience. From helping restaurants of all sizes thrive, to enabling diners to find and book the perfect table for every occasion, our story is one of human connection—among diners and restaurants, and between restaurants and their communities.

                            Restaurant loyalty programs are the best method for encouraging your customers to order more and more often. Rewarding them will make customers feel important and appreciated. This is how you develop loyalty.
                            It is worth noting that 30% of restaurants offer various types of loyalty programs to their customers, while 57% of restaurant customers declare that they are happier to eat in restaurants that offer such a program. (source).
                            Launching and using a restaurant loyalty program may seem quite complicated. How will points be applied? How to add points for online orders? Allow us to answer! Thanks to the UpMenu system, you will offer an intuitive and user-friendly loyalty program to your customers.
