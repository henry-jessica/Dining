<h1 align="center">Dining - Interactive Frontend Development - Web Desing Fundamentals Project</h1>

On my birthday we decided to schedule a celebration dinner at the Bistro Restaurant in Sligo. the problem arose when booking the table, they said there was no table available on my birthday. Then, we started calling several restaurants in Sligo and after 40 minutes we finally found a table available at a restaurant in a neighboring town. After this problem I thought of a solution to prevent people wasting time calling restaurants without a table available. So, my solution consists of a website where people can search for restaurants in a city and find all restaurants with a table available - where, when, at what time, how many guests.

  ## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals
      1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the Dining Booking Table.
      2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
      3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to have option to see daily offers from restaurants near me.

      -   #### Returning Visitor Goals
     1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find what restaurant has table available on the date and time and many seats that I would like.
     2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see the specialty of the restaurant and what people are saying about them.
     3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see the new picture of the food, location also time opened and closed.
     4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to create my menu to receive special offers.

      -   #### Frequent User Goals   
     1. As a Frequent User, I want to know the offers.
     2. As a Frequent User, I want to watch and see if I catch the restuarant menu.
     3. As a Frequent User, I want to share the link with my friends.
     4. As a Frequent User, I want to booking also my friends, so they receive email notifications.


-   ### Design

    -   #### General
- This webpage was created as a responsive, giving the appearence of an app with cards containing the content. If opened in devices with larger screen, the cards are going to be resized and be shown in 2 columns, this make the site easier to mantain if necessary to include or remove cards.

    -   #### Colour Scheme
- For the determination of the colors, a study on the psychology of the colors was carried out, then decided. In the documentation this is more detailed about the hex reference of the colors.

    -   #### Typography
- The Typo Oval Light Demo font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Typo Oval Light Demo  is a clean font used frequently in sophisticated designs, so it is both attractive, appropriate and memorable.
The same Font was used for the Logo. 

   -   #### Imagery
- Imagery is important, it is using free image sites to avoid future copyright issues.

## Collaboration

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
